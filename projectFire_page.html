        About
    </h3>

    <p>
        Brought about by the way of a D&D Game, Project Fire started as the backstory
        of a character I made for a D&D session I had one day during my early years
        in University. Afterwards, when the group dissolved and the sessions grew
        to be nothing but a memory I still kept on with developing the story. Growing
        it, creating characters, environments, and lore to fully realize what I saw that
        day while I sat in the basement of one of my classmates.

        Eventually, I signed on for a university class that taught the fundamentals of
        game design and production using the Unity Engine. I knew I had to develop a story
        world for this hypothetical game so I chose the story for my character, a man named
        Tearyn Grimwald, as a basis for the story. Over time, as I spent time within the
        world of Tearyn I started to see who he was, the characters he knew, and the world
        he lived in.

        I started to think of how I could show this to the world, so I decided to start utilizing
        the skills I had picked up over the years. I delved into his world and tried my best to
        depict what he saw through Digital Drawings, Videos, Music, and Character voices. what
        you see here is a product of those ambitions I had while I spent time in the world
        of Project Fire.
