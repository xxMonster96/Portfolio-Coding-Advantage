                <h5 class="blackText">Well, what can I say that you haven't heard in a billion of other artist/designer
                    portfolio websites? I draw and I paint to make my ideas a reality mostly. But,
                    I also take some other avenues of creation such as music, writing, voice acting,
                    and even game creation!
                </h5>

                <h5 class="blackText">I was born in Fort Nelson, BC. A small little town in the middle of the forest
                    in northern British Columbia. I grew up always knowing video games and
                    eventually I was introduced to my first love, art. Ever since then,
                    Art and I have a rather spotty relationship; only recently we became a rather
                    serious bunch. And, eventually, I also found that I liked to create video games
                    when I was introduced to Unity. So much so, that I went as far as designing
                    an entire world for a hypothetical video game that I work on in my spare time.
                </h5>

                <h5 class="blackText">I like to live vicariously through my characters and the worlds that I create. 
                    Imagining incredible adventures and impossible sights is what I see when I close my eyes.
                </h5>

                <h5 class="blackText">But, other than that, some of the things I like to do besides art and video games
                    are playing the piano, riding my motorcycle when it's a nice day, and camping
                    when I have more than an hour of free time.
                </h5>

                <h5 class="blackText">But, I'm sure you're bored to death about me talking about myself, so how about
                    we talk about you? Let's get in touch here at my email.
                </h5>

                <h5 class="blackText">
                    I hope to hear from you and hope you have a wonderful day!
