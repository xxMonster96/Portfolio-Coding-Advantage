        Well, what can I say that you haven't heard in a billion of other artist/designer
        portfolio websites? I draw and I paint to make my ideas a reality mostly. But,
        I also take some other avenues of creation such as music, writing, voice acting,
        and even game creation!
    </p>

    <p>
        I was born in Fort Nelson, BC. A small little town in the middle of the forest
        in northern British Columbia. I grew up always knowing video games and
        eventually I was introduced to my first love, art. Ever since then,
        Art and I have a rather spotty relationship; only recently we became a rather
        serious bunch. And, eventually, I also found that I liked to create video games
        when I was introduced to Unity. So much so, that I went as far as designing
        an entire world for a hypothetical video game that I work on in my spare time.
    </p>

    <p>
        I like to vicariously through my characters and worlds that I create. Imagining
        incredible adventures and impossible sights is what I see when I close my eyes.
    </p>

    <p>
        But, other than that, some of the things I like to do besides art and video games
        are playing the piano, riding my motorcycle when it's a nice day, and camping
        when I have more than an hour of free time.

        But, I'm sure you're bored to death about me talking about myself, so how about
        we talk about you? Let's get in touch here at my email.
    </p>

    <p>
        I hope to hear from you and hope you have a wonderful day!
